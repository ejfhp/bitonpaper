# Bit On Paper

BitcoinOnPaper (BOP) is a web application and an Android app to build Paper wallets for Bitcoin.
BOP has been built for Bitcoin (BSV) and the main scope is to be able to print Bitcoin addresses and private keys on paper.
Paper wallets (or Bitcoin on paper) can be given as gifts.
Paper wallets can be used to store Bitcoin but be careful because they can be lost or become unreadable.
Be aware that BOP is a free application without any kind of guarantee. It could have malfunctioning. Use it at your own risk. 

**This is a Work In Progress**
